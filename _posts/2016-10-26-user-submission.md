## How Content Is Currently Handled: by whom, to whom and where it ends up

**Example: Event**

The overseer of an event (can be a department chair, departmental admin, student group leader, etc.) possesses the following:
* **knowledge** of the event (maybe they coordinated)
* is in contact with event participants
 - obtains promotional image
 - obtains bio to be used in digital promotional material
 - knows if the participants are a member of the SAIC community (faculty, student, alum)
* creates promotional poster for print and digital dissemination

This individual gathers all of these pieces and submits them to the online updates email account for:
1. Updating the site where appropriate (departmental news/events, highlights) **Web Services**
2. inclusion in weekly campus email **MarketComm**
3. Marketing and promotion on campus
 - Campus calendar (for digital signage) **Web Services**
 - Poster display (for digital signage) **MarketComm**
4. Special Requests as needed
 - (primarily a special email send; other requests include social media and placement on site)

In this process, the individual submitting the event *has no direct access to the event content*, and is merely **handing off knowledge**. When updates or edits are required, the request has to go through the same process as it did upon initial event submission.
