## How Content Is Currently Handled: by whom, to whom and where it ends up

**Example: Event**

The overseer of an event (can be a department chair, departmental admin, student group leader, etc.) possesses the following:

* **knowledge** of the event (maybe they coordinated)
* is in contact with event participants
  - obtains promotional image
  - obtains bio to be used in digital promotional material
  - knows if the participants are a member of the SAIC community (faculty, student, alum)
* creates promotional poster for print and digital dissemination

This individual gathers all of these pieces and submits them to the online updates email account for:

1. Updating the site where appropriate (departmental news/events, highlights) **Web Services**
2. inclusion in weekly campus email **MarketComm**
3. Marketing and promotion on campus
  - Campus calendar (for digital signage) **Web Services**
  - Poster display (for digital signage) **MarketComm**
4. Special Requests as needed
  - (primarily a special email send; other requests include social media and placement on site)

In this process, the individual submitting the event *has no direct access to the event content*, and is merely **handing off knowledge**. When updates or edits are required, the request has to go through the same process as it did upon initial event submission.

While this example utilizes an event, the same pattern can be found when dealing with content updates on departmental and administrative pages across the entire site, faculty profile updates, featured student/alumni profile updates, faculty accomplishments, to name a few.
