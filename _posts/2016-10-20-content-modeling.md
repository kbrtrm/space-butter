<div class="message">
  We (YOU and I) are going to try to figure out how we'd rebuild our school's website. We work for an art school. Weâ€”admittedly, know nothing, but we'll be publicly working through our ideas because it feels real... er here.

OK. So, it's been five years since the last site was "launched" and, well, now it's old. Not only is it old, but it a) doesn't work, b) remains uneditable by most of it's intended users, and c) is a breeding-ground for ownership conflict.

## Whose content is it?

You can't be everything for everyone. The current site tries to do exactly that. The most important change we're considering is separating ownership based on audience (internal vs. external). In our case, we deem internal as those who already have a connection to the institution: current students, faculty, staff, etc. The external audience is primarily prospective students. These two groups have vastly different content needs.[^fn-sample_footnote]
